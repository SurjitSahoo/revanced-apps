# Release Logs# ReVanced Apps Patch & Release Automation



This branch contains only the pipeline execution logs and release history for the ReVanced Apps project.## Project Overview



## Generated FilesThis project automates the process of downloading APK files for selected Android applications, patching them using [ReVanced CLI](https://github.com/ReVanced/revanced-cli), and publishing the successfully patched APKs as a GitHub Release. If any APK fails to patch, the workflow automatically creates a GitHub Issue with error details for further investigation.



- `pipeline_history.json` - Complete history of all pipeline runs**Key Features:**

- `release_history.json` - History of all GitHub releases created

- `pending_release.json` - Information about releases that are pending- Downloads APKs from specified mirror links.

- `dashboard.html` - HTML dashboard with pipeline status overview- Patches APKs using the latest ReVanced tools.

- Publishes patched APKs as a GitHub Release with summary notes.

## Purpose- Creates detailed GitHub Issues for failed patches.

- **üìä Comprehensive pipeline logging and status tracking**

This branch is automatically updated by GitHub Actions to keep logs separate from the main source code branch.- **üéØ Visual dashboard for monitoring pipeline health**

- Designed to run as a scheduled or manual GitHub Actions workflow.

The main source code remains clean in the `main` branch, while all operational logs are maintained here.

> **Note:** The project is a proof-of-concept for the backend automation. A companion Flutter client app is planned for the future.
